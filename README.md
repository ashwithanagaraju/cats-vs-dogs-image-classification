# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

This project implements a binary image classification system to distinguish between cat and dog images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The solution applies deep learning techniques to learn visual patterns from image data and perform automated classification based on extracted features.

The project focuses on end-to-end image classification using neural network architectures, incorporating data preprocessing and model evaluation to assess classification performance. It demonstrates how convolutional models can be applied to visual recognition tasks, highlighting practical considerations in training and validating image-based machine learning systems in applied computer vision contexts.
